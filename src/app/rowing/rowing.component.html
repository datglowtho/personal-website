                        met some incredible people and had the opportunity to push myself to
                        achieve things I never believed I would. One day I would like to use
                        these pages to tell the story in full, but for now please enjoy this brief
                        summary and collection of images from my 10+ years of rowing.</strong>
                    </h4>
                    <p class="p2"><strong>Early years</strong></p>
                    <p class="concise">After around a year messing around on my dad's rowing machine I first sat
                        in a boat aged 10. I learnt to row at
                        <i>Canford Crocodiles</i>, a weekly club for kids looking to
                        try rowing before they went to Canford School. I stayed there for around a
                        year and got my first taste of racing, before moving to a club closer
                        to home, Coalporters, after deciding to go to King Edward VI in
                        Southampton.</p>
                    <p class="p2"><strong>The English Channel</strong></p>
                    <p class="concise">Coalporters is a coastal rowing club, which
                        meant that races with them usually consisted of battling wind and waves
                        off the South Coast. It was there I had my crazy idea to row
                        across the English Channel, which I saw to completion in 2012, making me the
                        youngest person ever to row it solo at age 15, raising over Â£20,000 for
                        Make-A-Wish in the process. Whilst fundraising at Henley
                        Royal Regatta that year I was introduced to the junior coach at Leander
                        Club, and a month after the cross-channel row I joined the junior squad
                        at Leander with a view to succeeding in more serious races.</p>
                    <p class="p2"><strong>Competitive Career</strong></p>
                    <p class="concise">During my time at Leander
                        I won the junior singles race at the Home International Regatta 2015 for
                        England, represented Great Britain at the Coupe de la Jeunesse 2014,
                        achieving a bronze and a silver medal, and won a
                        number of domestic medals at the British Junior Championships and
                        the National Schools Regatta. Since moving to university I left Leander
                        to row for Imperial and here I have won IM1 quads at Fours Head, won the
                        open quads event at BUCS Head, and recently in July made it through to
                        the quarter-finals of the Diamond Sculls event at Henley Royal Regatta,
                        where I was knocked out (as expected) by Olympic silver medallist Cam
                        Girdlestone.
