                    met some incredible people and had the opportunity to push myself to
                    achieve things I never believed I would. One day I would like to use
                    these pages to tell the story in full, but for now please enjoy this brief
                    summary and collection of images from my 10+ years of rowing.</strong>

                <p style="text-indent: 5%">After around a year messing around on my dad's rowing machine I first sat
                    in a boat aged 10. I learnt to row at
                    <i>Canford Crocodiles</i>, a weekly club for kids looking to
                    try rowing before they went to Canford School. I stayed there for around a
                    year and got my first taste of racing, before moving to a club closer
                    to home, Coalporters, after choosing to go to King Edwards in
                    Southampton instead of Canford. </p><p style="margin-top: 0; text-indent: 5%">Coalporters is a coastal rowing club, which
                    meant that races with them usually consisted of battling wind and waves
                    off a beach on the South Coast. It was there I had my crazy idea to row
                    across the English Channel, which I saw to completion in 2012, making me the
                    youngest person ever to row it solo at age 15, raising over Â£20,000 for
                    Make-A-Wish in the process. Whilst fundraising at Henley
                    Royal Regatta that year I was introduced to the junior coach at Leander
                    Club, and a month after the cross-channel row I joined the junior squad
                    at Leander and properly began my racing career.</p><p style="margin-top: 0; text-indent: 5%">During my time at Leander
                    I won the junior singles race at the Home International Regatta 2015 for
                    England, represented Great Britain at the Coupe de la Jeunesse 2014,
                    achieving a bronze and a silver medal, and won a
                    number of domestic medals at the British Junior Championships and
                    the National Schools Regatta. Since moving to university I left Leander
                    to row for Imperial and here I have won IM1 quads at Fours Head, won the
                    open quads event at BUCS Head, and recently in July made it through to
                    the quarter-finals of the Diamond Sculls event at Henley Royal Regatta,
                    where I was knocked out (as expected) by Olympic silver medallist Cam
                    Girdlestone.
