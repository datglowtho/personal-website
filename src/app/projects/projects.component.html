                    <p class="concise">ARi was made as part of the WebApps project in the summer
                    term of the second year Computing course at Imperial. The app could be desktop
                    or mobile, had to allow for rich user interactions (e.g. messaging, scoreboards, etc.) and
                    use a database to maintain some internal state, such as user-specific data. Additionally,
                    this project is run in conjunction with a Human Centred Design (HCD) course from the Royal College of Art.
                    This meant we were making an app to solve some problem our potential users currently face, and had
                    to keep the user in mind at all times when designing and developing it.

                    <p class="p2" id="ARi-problem">The Problem</p>
                    <p class="concise">In the Department of Computing at Imperial, there are lots
                    of online services through which students can communicate with their lecturers
                        or access resources such as lecture slides/videos. The main platforms are:</p>
                    <ul class="outer">
                        <li><strong>CATe</strong> - Coursework management system with many features including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Access to resources such as lecture slides and coursework specs.</li>
                            <li>Digital coursework submission.</li>
                            <li>Online grades viewer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Piazza</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Predominantly a Q&A platform.</li>
                            <li>Also hosts resources such as lecture slides.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Panopto</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lecturers use the Panopto app to record and upload their lectures.</li>
                            <li>Students use the website or app to view recordings of past lectures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="concise">All of these services work very well in their own right but
                    together they lead to frustration for both lecturers and students. A big problem
                    we focused on is accessing resources such as lecture slides. Some students would go to CATe first to look for
                    these, some would go to Piazza. Lecturers tend not to upload things to two
                    separate places and none of us expect them to but this leads to confusion and wasted study time.
                    There are also a couple of other places lecturers can (and do) host resources so this is something that really
                        needed a solution.</p>
                    <p class="concise">The other main problem we targeted is the separation of these services. Students find
                    themselves not using excellent learning resources such as Piazza's Q&A and Panopto's lecture
                    recordings to their full potential because they aren't integrated with each other. Each of them is another tab
                    on their computer and another search for the right lecture.</p>

                    <p class="concise">Our aim for the project was to create a unified system that brings together CATe, Piazza and
                    Panopto into a streamlined system that would help students study and reduce the amount of time it takes lecturers
                    to interact with their students. This system is ARi (pronounced 'ahh-ree') and its main features are:
                    <ul class="outer">
                        <li><strong>ARiViewer</strong> - A revising student's dream. One page for all four of the following:

                            <li>Asking a question about this lecture and quick links to relevant questions.</li>
                            <li>All of these can be hidden or re-sized so students can adjust the page to best suit them.</li>

                    <p class="concise">These two core features were the main focus of our project.
                    Given that we only had three weeks to work on this project, we couldn't hope to
                    make these two in a whole system that had all of the features CATe has as well.
                    However, we really wanted to show our vision for ARi and what a better version
                    of the Department of Computing online experience could look like. So we presented
                    these main two fully functional parts of our app in a proof of concept for the
                    rest of ARi. This featured a home page with some hard-coded information such as
                    timetable for the week ahead and upcoming coursework deadlines alongside
                    real data such as recent questions in AskARi and recently uploaded lectures.
                    It also has an easy-to-navigate layout, with AskARi and our courses page only a
                    click away. The courses page has all the lectures available to that student,
                    organised in a stack view by module. When a lecturer uses ARi, they have the same
                    view as a student, but with the option to add a new lecture to a course that they teach.
                    We chose to make the layout the same so that a lecturer knows exactly what a student
                        will see when they come to access the uploaded materials.</p>

                    <p class="p2" id="ARi-how-it-works">How it Works</p>
                    <p class="concise">ARi is developed using Angular on the front-end and Django on
                    the back-end with a PostgreSQL database. We used the Clarity design system to help
                    make our interface as clean and easy-to-use as possible. Any student from the Department
                    of Computing can log in to ARi as we connect to the college's LDAP directory to
                    authenticate users. We also check what LDAP groups a user is part of to determine if they
                    are a lecturer or a student and what modules they take or teach. We use this information
                    to only show modules relevant to that user. When a lecturer creates a new lecture on ARi they
                    upload a pdf file for the slides and give us a URL to the Panopto recording of it. We chose
                    to keep Panopto for the recording of lectures as of course we did not have time to create a
                    video recording feature that works as well as Panopto's. Then when a student uses the ARiViewer
                        we fetch the video from Panopto and embed it on the page.</p>
                    <p class="concise">On the HCD side of things, we made sure to involve ARi's stakeholders as much as
                    possible. Before implementing anything, we created mock-ups for the whole site and gathered
                    feedback on the design. We then asked the same people for feedback again once each feature was finished
                    to make sure it matched their expectations and ask if they thought any improvements needed making.
                    We also collected quantitative data such as the number of clicks it takes to do things on our site
                    and compared this to doing the same things on the currently used platforms.</p>

                    <p class="concise">I worked on ARi with Sarah Baka, Ruhi Choudhury, Josh Cooper. I was predominantly working on
                        the back-end, and wrote about 80 percent of the Django code. At all times I aimed for the back-end code to
                        be as clean and well-designed as possible so that in the future new features could be added with ease. I'm really proud
                        with the end result but am unfortunately unable to share it on my public GitHub at this time.
                    <p class="concise">ARi received very high marks and we have been invited to present it at upcoming interview days.
                    Professor Susan Eisenbach expressed interest in seeing ARi developed further and offered to be our supervisor if we wished
                    to continue work on ARi for the third year group project.

                    <p class="concise">At the end of the first year of Computing at Imperial there
                    is a C project for groups of 4 to implement an assembler for ARM assembly code
                    and an emulator to simulate the execution of the code on a Raspberry Pi.
                    The extension part of the project is to design, implement and document
                    an extension of our choice to do with the Raspberry Pi. It could
                    be written in either C (and run within the Raspbian OS), or bare-metal assembly.
                    We opted for the former.</p>
                    <p class="p2" id="BBts-features">Project Features</p>
                    <p class="concise">Our group's idea was to make a basic touch-sensitive keyboard
                    for the Raspberry Pi with a GUI written in C to accompany it.
                    The keyboard uses 12 bananas instead of conventional keys,
                    hence the name "BananaBeats". The GUI features radio buttons
                    to change instrument, a volume slider and 12 icons which light
                    up when the corresponding banana is being touched. This can be seen
                    in Fig. 3. The instruments are "Drums", "Piano" and "Mario",
                    the latter being a soundboard of Super Mario sound effects
                        that we decided to put in for fun.</p>

                    <p class="p2" id="BBts-how-it-works">How it Works</p>
                    <p class="concise">On the hardware side, to make the keyboard we used a Capacitive Touch HAT add-on from
                    Adafruit. This has 12 capacitive touch pins, meaning when something
                    that conducts electricity touches a pin (like a finger), a charge is transferred to it.
                    This creates a voltage drop allowing the Pi to know a pin has been
                    touched. Bananas work as keys because they conduct electricity due
                    to their high water content, and they are connected to the pins by
                        pushing wires into the bananas and connecting the wires to the pins.</p><p class="concise">
                    As for the software, we wrote the GUI in C using GTK+. The software
                    for connecting to the touch HAT, however, was easiest written in
                    Python. Therefore we run the GUI in one thread and run a Python
                    script to detect key presses and play sounds in another. We
                    use the C/Python interface to allow the Python code to call
                        our C functions for lighting up the icons on the GUI.</p>

                    Maurice Yap and Josh Cooper. We won 3rd place out of around 40 groups doing
                    this project that year. Following this, we were invited to
