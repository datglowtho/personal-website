                                Truly a film where the "edge of your seat" cliché is
                                meant literally. As the film progressed I genuinely
                                found myself sitting up and inching forward, in no
                                small part thanks to Hans Zimmer's incredible score.
                                I've seen some criticism calling the out-of-order storytelling
                                unnecessary which I must contend, as the movie would
                                not be nearly as intense if the dogfight wasn't taking
                                place the entire time.

                                I really enjoyed this movie as I was watching it, but
                                then immediately felt a bit underwhelmed by it as soon
                                as I left the cinema. It may well be one of the best Spider-Man

                                both "just another Spider-Man movie" and "just another

                                As a longtime Legend of Zelda fan, I was very excited
                                for Breath of the Wild but also quite sceptical of the
                                praise it was receiving. However as the game unfolded
                                I became increasingly captivated by it.
                                Don't let the colourful art style deceive
                                you - this is arguably the most realistic game I've ever played.
                                Almost every element behaves how you would expect it to in the real world.
                                Maybe not my favourite Zelda game only for its minimal story,
                                but it certainly comes close.

                                I adore Fire Emblem. There's no other series of games
                                where defeat is so crushing, or victory is so relieving.
                                Fire Emblem Fates is actually split across three games,
                                which I'm enjoying slowly making my way through, a few chapters at
                                a time, often during a long journey. I'm currently near the
                                end of Conquest, the second game and loving
                                the incredible variety of battles it offers, requiring
                                me to think of different strategies for every battle.

                                Watching the film before reading one of Alan Moore's
                                books is often a dangerous way to play it. Thankfully
                                then, the film adaptation told the story in a
                                very different way to the book, allowing me to

                                Kick-Ass is, in a word, awesome. I don't think I've

                                Occasionally I'll watch a movie or TV show and a
                                particularly hard punch will make me gasp, but never
                                a comic book. That is until Kick-Ass. John Romita Jr's

                                this book is a lot of fun and well worth a read.

                                It's not really clear whether Tom Sherlock is back
                                as Henry Homesweet, or whether TRUTHR is his new
                                alias as well as the EP title. Regardless of what the
                                artist calls himself, TRUTHR is a very impressive
                                collection of tracks. In particular Earth II,
                                which has such excellent sound design that it's
                                hard to believe it was made using a Commodore 64's
                                sound chip. The only weak point of the album in my
                                opinion is the second track, Chem Moon. Although I
                                enjoy it, it doesn't really fit with the summery vibe
                                of the rest of the EP.

                                I've only recently discovered PERTURBATOR's music,
                                and I think I'm becoming slightly addicted to it.
                                It's genre is probably best categorised as darkwave,
                                and it paints the picture of a horror/sci-fi future
                                from an 80s movie, but does so with a modern brush.
                                It's captivating, thrilling and is perfect for
                                bombing down the motorway in the dead of night.
