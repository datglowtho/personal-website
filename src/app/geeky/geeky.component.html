                            Truly a film where the "edge of your seat" cliché is
                            meant literally. As the film progressed I genuinely
                            found myself sitting up and inching forward, in no
                            small part thanks to Hans Zimmer's incredible score.
                            I've seen some criticism calling the out-of-order storytelling
                            unnecessary but I disagree, the movie would
                            not be nearly as intense if that central dogfight wasn't taking
                            place the entire time.

                            I really enjoyed this movie as I was watching it, but
                            then immediately felt a bit underwhelmed by it as soon
                            as I left the cinema. It may well be one of the best Spider-Man
                            movies, but at the end of the day it suffers from feeling like
                            both "just another Spider-Man movie" and "just another
                            Marvel movie".

                            As a longtime Legend of Zelda fan, I was very excited
                            for Breath of the Wild but also quite sceptical of the
                            praise it was receiving. However as the game unfolded
                            I became increasingly captivated by it.
                            Don't let the colourful art style deceive
                            you - this is arguably the most realistic game I've ever played.
                            Almost every element behaves how you would expect it to in the real world.
                            Maybe not my favourite Zelda game only for its minimal story,
                            but it certainly comes close.

                            I adore Fire Emblem. There's no other series of games
                            where defeat is so crushing, or victory is such a relief.
                            Fire Emblem Fates is actually split across three games,
                            which I enjoy slowly making my way through, a few chapters at
                            a time, often during a long journey. I'm currently near the
                            end of Revelation, the final game and though Fates doesn't
                            quite reach the heights of other entries, it is holding
                            me over until the upcoming Fire Emblem: Three Houses on
                            Switch.

                            Watching the film before reading one of Alan Moore's
                            books is often a dangerous way to play it. Thankfully
                            then, the film adaptation told the story in a
                            very different way to the book, allowing me to
                            enjoy the read without constantly discovering
                            how the film missed the point. Like other Alan
                            Moore works I have read, V for Vendetta was an outstanding,
                            exciting story filled with harrowing similarities to
                            the real world. Powerful stuff that really makes you

                            Kick-Ass is, in a word, awesome. I don't think I've
                            ever seen gory violence in a comic book on this level.
                            Occasionally I'll watch a movie or TV show and a
                            particularly hard punch will make me gasp, but never
                            a comic book. That is until Kick-Ass. John Romita Jr's
                            cinematic artwork executes the level of violence Mark
                            Millar was aiming for perfectly. The book is also genuinely
                            funny, and has some unexpected twists. Though short,
                            this book is a lot of fun and well worth a read.

                            as Henry Homesweet, or whether TRUTHR is his new
                            alias as well as the EP title. Regardless of what the
                            artist calls himself, TRUTHR is a very impressive
                            collection of tracks. In particular Earth II,
                            which has such excellent sound design that it's
                            hard to believe it was made using a Commodore 64's
                            sound chip. The only weak point of the album in my
                            opinion is the second track, Chem Moon. Although I
                            enjoy it, it doesn't really fit with the summery vibe
                            of the rest of the EP.

                            I've only recently discovered PERTURBATOR's music,
                            and I think I'm becoming slightly addicted to it.
                            It's genre is probably best categorised as darkwave,
                            and it paints the picture of a horror/sci-fi future
                            from an 80s movie, but does so with a modern brush.
                            It's captivating, thrilling and is perfect for
                            bombing down the motorway in the dead of night.
